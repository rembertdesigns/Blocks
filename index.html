        <p>For my theme song (Black)
            My leather black jeans on (Black)
            My by-any-means on
            Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (Black)
            Enter the kingdom (Black)
            But watch who you bring home
            They see a black man with a white woman
            At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong</p>
        <p>Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
            Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
            The only rapper compared to Michael
            So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
            And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
            And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
            Old niggas mentally still in high school
            Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you</p>
        <p>They throwin' hate at me
            Want me to stay at ease
            Fuck you and your corporation
            Y'all niggas can't control me
            I know that we the new slaves
            I know that we the new slaves
            I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
            I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
            I know that pussy ain't free
            You niggas pussy, ain't me
            Y'all throwin' contracts at me
            You know that niggas can't read
            Throw on some Maybach keys</p>
